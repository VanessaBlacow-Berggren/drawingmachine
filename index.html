    <h3>In some religious texts, the rainbow is a promise from God to not destroy all life on earth once again with a flood; that is why whenever it rains a rainbow appears as the symbol of that promise. I decided to play with this concept of a rainbow being a promise with this project. Here you type a promise to yourself and then you draw your own rainbow to seal that promise with yourself. I also decided to make the rainbow similar to a ribbon because some people tie string or ribbons around their finger to remember something, so having the rainbow look like a ribbon is so that you will remember the promise you made.</h3>
